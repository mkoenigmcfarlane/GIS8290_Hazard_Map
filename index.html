			<h2>Flood</h2>
			<p>We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... i once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. only perfect intentions. no, this is mount everest. you should flip on the discovery channel from time to time. but i guess you can't now, being dead and all. holy jesus. what are these goddamn animals? that tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. holy jesus. what are these goddamn animals? i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. me? i'm dishonest, and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. honestly. it's the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly... stupid. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. bruce... i'm god. well, then, i confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out.</p>
