		<div class="col-md-10"><h2 id="study1">Case Study #1: San Bernardino, California</h2>
      <p><b>The Hazards</b></p>
			<p>In the hazard map provided in this project, San Bernardino, California, has the highest cumulative score for disasters at 24. The county currently has the following scores for potential disasters:</p>
			<p> Wildfire - 4 <br> Earthquake - 4 <br> Floods - 4 <br> Winter Weather - 4 <br> Volcanoes - 3 <br> Hurricane - 2 <br> Tornadoes -2 <br>Nuclear plants - 1  </p>
      
			<p>This county has high rankings, if not the highest, for multiple natural disasters. USA.com reported that the county has experienced a total of 1,270 “other weather extremes” events - which exclude earthquakes, volcanoes, and tornadoes - within 50 miles of San Bernardino County were recorded from 1950 to 2010. In fact, according to the United States Geological Survey, 21.1% of San Bernardino’s land area is at risk of wildfires, and there is an 89% chance that a 5.0 magnitude earthquake will hit the region in the next 50 years. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the county to have strong emergency preparedness and response in place to limit the amount of damage and loss that may occur during these natural disasters.</p>
      
      <p><b>County Demographics</b></p>
      <p>The county of San Bernardino has had a growing and changing population, particularly in recent years since 2000. It is an entirely urban setting, with a total population of over 213,708 residents (as of 2013), which has grown more than 20% since 2000. The residents in this county have struggled with poverty. In 2013, approximately 34.4% of residents were living in poverty. The estimated median household income is $37,440 and  the estimated per capita income is $14,314 (2013). About 14% of residents are unemployed. This indicates that government entities and other service providers, will want to seek emergency plans that will be low-resource for residents and/or that public and private actors will need to seek ways to equip residents with certain crucial tools.</p>
       <p>San Bernardino has a very diverse population in regards to race, language, and religion. In 2013, the racial demographics were Hispanic (62.4%), White alone (16.6%), Black alone (13.4%), Asian alone (7% in 2015), Two or more races (1.8%), American Indian alone (0.4%), Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone (0.4%), and Other race alone (0.4%). In addition, in 2015 the county found that 22.2% of all residents are foreign born and that 41% of the county’s population speak a language other than English at home. Most of residents (82%) speak Spanish and 18% speak a language other than English or Spanish. This is crucial information for emergency preparedness and response teams to know to properly serve everyone in the San Bernardino community. This means that such teams should have interpreters to communicate with residents in different languages and have translated materials available to help people understand the natural disaster risks in the area. This information is also helpful to have because it can help emergency teams understand what previous experiences residents have had with natural disasters. A person who is newer to San Bernardino may have no experience with wildfires or earthquakes, and therefore may not know how to best respond if one occurs. On the other hand, someone else may have a lot of experience with floods, for example, but may have a lot of trauma from those experiences. Therefore, when delivering emergency preparedness to community members, trainers cannot assume levels of experience and should therefore teach information at different levels and be conscious of potential issues that may trigger people’s trauma.</p>
      <p>Age is also important to examine in a location when looking at disasters. As of 2013, 28% of the county’s population was under age 18, while 10% were 65 years or older. This means that if a disaster occurs, emergency responders may prioritize their activities around schools in the area (many of which hold over 2,000 students each), since children at school are separated from family and may not have the knowledge or resources to help them seek safety during the disaster. The county also has 10 major nursing homes, which may host particularly vulnerable populations since some elderly residents may need special assistance due to health concerns, need for medications and certain equipment, and/or disabilities (for example, they have difficulty seeing or hearing the disaster or instructions on how to seek safety).</p>
      <p>In terms of education, most school-aged children will be in school, though the county has a 12.2% student dropout rate. Overall, most adults in the area are not college-educated. Of adults over the age of 25, 66.6% have obtained an education of high school, 11.5% have a Bachelor's degree or higher, and 3.3% have Graduate or professional degrees. Furthermore, according to the most recent data available, in 2003 one out of five adults in San Bernardino was estimated to lack basic literacy skills. Therefore, not only should emergency materials be translated, as mentioned before, but the plan should be written - or perhaps orally explained - clearly to everyone. </p>
      
      <p><b>Housing/Shelter</b></p>
      <p>Residents’ shelter should be considered in disaster management in terms of where resident populations have higher density, areas that could have particular vulnerable populations, and locations that could serve as shelters in a crisis situation. The following group housing information (from 2010), could be helpful:</p>
      <p>1,659 people in local jails and other municipal confinement facilities<br>1,506 people in mental (psychiatric) hospitals and psychiatric units in other hospitals<br> 1,087 people in college/university student housing <br>878 people in nursing facilities/skilled-nursing facilities<br>870 people in other noninstitutional facilities<br>559 people in group homes intended for adults<br>229 people in residential treatment centers for adults<br>187 people in correctional facilities intended for juveniles<br>152 people in emergency and transitional shelters (with sleeping facilities) for people experiencing homelessness</p>
      <p>Prisons are a unique situation in that they are usually constructed with strong materials, usually to prevent inmates from getting out, but may prove to be strong against storms, for example. At the same time, though, if a prison is damaged, county residents may feel concerned about their safety if inmates have escaped, and it also means that those individuals do not have resources (material, financial, telecommunications, etc.) in order to survive extreme disasters such as flooding or volcanic activity. Another housing issues to highlight from this list are mental and psychiatric hospitals. In the 2015 San Bernardino report, it stated that “approximately 65,500 low-income residents of San Bernardino County were estimated to have a serious mental illness and needed mental health services in 2013/14,” and 46,211 residents are currently receiving mental health services. This means that emergency preparedness and response actors may need to find unique ways of educating these residents about disasters, while also being sensitive to residents who may have anxiety or trauma about these issues. It is important, again, for residents and service-providers to have emergency contacts for residents with mental health concerns, to have emergency plans/protocol in place, and to have clear understanding of who is responsible for whom or what. Lastly, it should be noted how many people in the county are already seeking emergency shelter. If all the main shelters are already at or over capacity, if a natural disaster occurs, the city needs to be ready to have additional shelter options.Prisons are a unique situation in that they are usually constructed with strong materials, usually to prevent inmates from getting out, but may prove to be strong against storms, for example.

Lastly, it should be noted how many people in the county are already seeking emergency shelter. If all the main shelters are already at or over capacity, if a natural disaster occurs, the city needs to be ready to have additional shelter options.</p>
      <p>While prisons and psychiatric facilities are not top options for shelters during crises,  other facilities such as hospitals and schools may be converted to temporary shelter sites. Another possible shelter option is places of worship. In San Bernardino, residents’ religious identities are mainly “None” (60%), Catholic (22%), and Evangelical Protestant (12%). Total, there are approximately 1,227 congregations in the county. These facilities can become partners with emergency planners to offer services such as shelter or food. It is also important to note, though, that it is important to understand the people who practice a certain religion, or none at all, may not feel comfortable if shelter is only offered in another type of religious place. Those establishing shelters should be mindful of religious artifacts present in the shelter, as well as gender dynamics (for example, some residents may prefer shelters to divide men and women) and food preferences.</p>
     
      <p><b>Livelihoods</b></p>
     <p>Understanding economics and livelihoods of residents in a certain setting are additional factors that help plan for emergencies and to understand a county’s recovery process. For example, if a location is mainly agricultural and there is a flood or hurricane, for instance, many residents’ livelihood could be damaged and struggle economically for much time following the event. In the case of San Bernardino, though, most people work outside the county. Only 35.6% of workers live and work in San Bernardino, and most commute 25-minutes by car to their work. The most common industries residents work in are:</p>
     <p> Health care and social assistance <br> Educational services <br> Retail trade <br> Construction <br> Manufacturing <br> Transportation and warehousing</p>
      <p>The good news about these sectors is that the area has human capital to respond to crises in that there are healthcare providers to address medical needs and skilled construction workers who can help rebuild infrastructure following natural disasters. It also means that if an emergency took place, for example a wildfire, many residents may be working elsewhere and not within the county limits to even experience, or be injured by, such a disaster. It does mean, though, that transportation infrastructure is very important. If an emergency happens in San Bernardino, residents’ livelihoods may likely be unharmed, but if roads are damaged, they will not be able to get to their workplace, which can have household economic impacts. </p>
      
      <p><b>Infrastructure</b></p>
      <p>Lastly, it is absolutely essential to see what infrastructure is currently in place, and what may be needed, to both prepare and respond to disasters. It can be examined what resources, capacities, and competencies are already present and can be leveraged in time of need. That information can also be used to see where residents are currently going to for help and which people, organizations, and processes they are familiar with. </p>
      <p>There are approximately 400 full-time law enforcement employees (with 1.15 officers per 1,000 residents) and 141 firefighters in San Bernardino. There are eight main hospitals that can provide medical services to residents, 10 airports that could help evacuate people and/or deliver basic need items, and there are 25 fire-safe hotels/motels in the county which would potentially serve as shelters. There are also 315 grocery stores and numerous restaurants that could help provide food items as well.  Other aspects to consider include bridges - in which there are 248 in the county which cause big logistical problems if damaged - and telecommunications. There are currently six TV stations in the area and approximately 36 strong radio stations, in which emergency alerts and updates can be provided to thousands of people to help keep them out of harm’s way.</p>
      
      <p><b>Past Experiences with Natural Disasters in San Bernardino</b></p>
      <p>The number of natural disasters in San Bernardino County is about four times greater than the national average.  There have been 26 major disasters (president) declared in recent history, which have included (some incidents may be assigned to more than one category): 21 fires, 18 floods, 9 storms, 6 winter storms, 5 landslides, 4 mudslides, 2 heavy rains, 1 earthquake, 1 flashflood, 1 freeze, 1 hurricane, 1 snow storm, 1 tornado, 1 tropical storm, 1 incident of strong winds</p>
      <p>In fact, San Bernardino is 725% more likely to have an earthquake than the overall U.S. average. Though there has only been one earthquake disaster in the past two decades, the county’s history illustrates that massive earthquakes have occurred, causing much damage and loss. USA.com reports several disasterous earthquakes effecting the county:</p>
      <p> 6/28/1992: a magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred 43.7 miles away from the city center, causing 3 deaths and 400 injuries, causing $100,000,000 total damage and $40,000,000 insured losses <br> 7/21/1952: a magnitude 7.7 earthquake occurred 114.4 miles away from San Bernardino center, causing $50,000,000 total damage<br> 10/16/1999: a magnitude 7.4 earthquake occurred 55.8 miles away from the city center<br>6/28/1992:, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake occurred 29.4 miles away from the city center <br> 5/19/1940: a magnitude 7.2 earthquake occurred 111.3 miles away from San Bernardino center, causing $33,000,000 total damage<br> 4/21/1918: a magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred 23.5 miles away from the city center</p>
      
      <p><b>Disaster preparedness considerations/recommendations</b></p>
      <p> - The Office of Emergency Services (County OES) is a Division of the San Bernardino County Fire Department. County OES is responsible for disaster planning and emergency management coordination throughout the San Bernardino County Operational Area (OA) by functioning as the Lead Agency for the OA. County OES serves a county population of over 2 million and over 20,100 square miles. While County OES does not directly manage field operations, as does an Incident Command Post (ICP), it ensures coordination of disaster response and recovery efforts through day-to-day program management and during a disaster/emergency.
